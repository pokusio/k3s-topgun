# The CICD System of the `k3d` project

In my opinion, for every open source project, one of the things that are extremely important to understand, and master, is the CICD System.

I would even state that a software is not truly open source, unless it own CICD System is open source :
* We must be able to reproduce all Processes of the CICD System,
* I this world, We have enough open source CI/CD Tools to reproduce any kind of automation
